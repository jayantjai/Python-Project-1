Key Highlights & Achievements:

Developed a Complete File Management Application

Built an interactive menu-driven Python program for file operations — create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) files.

Designed the program with modular functions (createfile(), readfile(), updatefile(), deletefile()) for better code organization and reusability.

Utilized Python Standard Libraries Efficiently

Used the pathlib module for advanced file and directory management.

Implemented os module functions like os.remove() and Path.rename() for file updates and deletions.

Enhanced User Experience

Integrated interactive input prompts for dynamic user operations.

Displayed current files and folders in the working directory before each action for user guidance.

Error Handling and Validation

Added robust exception handling using try-except blocks to catch and report runtime errors gracefully.

Implemented checks to prevent overwriting or deleting non-existent files, ensuring safe file operations.

Programming Concepts Demonstrated

Mastery of conditional statements, functions, loops, exception handling, and file I/O operations.

Showcased ability to build real-world automation tools using only Python’s core libraries.

🧩 Tools & Libraries Used

Python, pathlib, os
